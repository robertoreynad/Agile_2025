# Team Charter – Financial Transactions Summary Tool

## 1. Team Members
- Kalid Sacbe Juarez Ponce
- Jose Osorio Davila
- Roberto Reyna Delgado
- Carlos Alberto Juarez Maldonado

## 2. Mission & Vision

**Mission**  
Develop a Python tool to process the *Financial Transactions Dataset* and produce clear, useful summaries of income and expenses, while applying Agile practices during a one-week sprint.

**Vision**  
Become a team that collaborates effectively using GitHub and Taiga, delivering modular, reusable code that can seamlessly integrate into a future dashboard or visualization.

## 3. Success Priorities

- Deliver a functional tool that meets all course requirements.
- Uphold high-quality Agile processes: frequent commits, branch usage with pull requests, and an up-to-date Taiga board.
- Ensure meaningful contributions from every team member.
- Provide clean, well-documented, and easily reusable code.
- Meet the deadline without last-minute workload spikes.

## 4. Working Agreements

- Primary communication channel: WhatsApp.
- Maximum response time to team messages: within 12 hours.
- Coordination meetings: two meetings during the sprint—one at the start and one at the midpoint.
- All tasks must be created and updated in Taiga before work begins.
- No direct merges to `main`: all changes require a pull request with at least one review.
- If a member cannot complete an assigned task, they must notify the team as soon as possible.

## 5. Definition of Done

A user story is considered **Done** when:

- The code is implemented and runs without errors.
- It has been reviewed by at least one teammate via pull request.
- Basic comments/docstrings are added to key functions.
- Tests or usage examples are updated as needed.
- The story is marked complete in Taiga.
- It is merged into the main branch (`main` or `master`) without conflicts.
