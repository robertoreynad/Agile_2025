# Team Charter – Financial Transactions Summary Tool

## 1. Team Members
- Kalid Sacbe Juarez Ponce
- Jose Osorio Davila
- Roberto Reyna Delgado
- Carlos Alberto Juarez Maldonado

## 2. Mission & Vision

**Mission**  
Develop a Python tool to process the *Financial Transactions Dataset* and produce clear, useful summaries of income and expenses, while applying Agile practices during a one-week sprint.

**Vision**  
Become a team that collaborates effectively using GitHub and Taiga, delivering modular, reusable code that can seamlessly integrate into a future dashboard or visualization.

## 3. Success Priorities

- Deliver a functional tool that meets all course requirements.
- Uphold high-quality Agile processes: frequent commits, branch usage with pull requests, and an up-to-date Taiga board.
- Ensure meaningful contributions from every team member.
- Provide clean, well-documented, and easily reusable code.
- Meet the deadline without last-minute workload spikes.

## 4. Working Agreements

- Primary communication channel: WhatsApp.
- Maximum response time to team messages: within 12 hours.
- Coordination meetings: two meetings during the sprint—one at the start and one at the midpoint.
- All tasks must be created and updated in Taiga before work begins.
- No direct merges to `main`: all changes require a pull request with at least one review.
- If a member cannot complete an assigned task, they must notify the team as soon as possible.

## 5. Definition of Done

A user story is considered **Done** when:

- The code is implemented and runs without errors.
- It has been reviewed by at least one teammate via pull request.
- Basic comments/docstrings are added to key functions.
- Tests or usage examples are updated as needed.
- The story is marked complete in Taiga.
- It is merged into the main branch (`main` or `master`) without conflicts.


## 6. Sprint Goal

Build a simple Python package that reads the dataset, cleans it, and shows key financial insights. Work will be tracked in Taiga and code shared on GitHub.


## 7. User Stories and Acceptance Criteria (initial ideas)

We are planning a few stories: Load and clean data, show monthly cash flow, analyse spending by category, list top merchants, run everything with one command and finally add all the documentation.


## 8. Project Structure (draft)

We plan to keep the project simple and organised as a basic setup like:
To have a README and requirements, also a data folder for the dataset. It is important also, to have a src folder with modules (loader, summary, analysis, plots) and a main.py to run all.

## 9. Collaboration Workflow (draft)

We are planning to have:
GitHub, where we are going to see the branches per feature, pull requests, commits linked to user stories.
Taiga, where we are going to see the backlog with stories, tasks moving To Do → In Progress → Done, instructor added.
